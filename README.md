# 🚀 Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get The Knowledge Bay up and running on your local machine.

## 💻 Client (Front-End)

1.  **Navigate to the client directory:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

## ⚙️ Server (Back-End)

1.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    (Assuming you are in the project root)
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2.  **Build the project and install dependencies:**
    This command compiles the Java code, runs tests, and packages the application.
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the Spring Boot application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4.  The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080` (Spring Boot's default port). You can access the API endpoints once the server has started successfully.

# 🎮 Usage

Once both the client and server are running, you can start using The Knowledge Bay:

1.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port your client is running on).

2.  **User Registration and Login:**
    - **Sign Up:** If you are a new user, look for a "Sign Up" or "Register" option. You will typically need to provide a username, email, and password.
    - **Log In:** If you already have an account, use the "Log In" or "Sign In" option with your credentials.

3.  **Navigating the Platform:**
    - After logging in, you'll likely land on a dashboard or home page.
    - Use the navigation bar or menu (often at the top or side of the page) to explore different sections such as:
        - Your user profile.
        - Areas for browsing or creating content (articles, resources, etc.).
        - Discussion forums or community pages.
        - Search functionality.

4.  **Interacting with Content:**
    - **Viewing:** Browse through available articles, documents, or other resources.
    - **Creating:** Depending on your permissions, you might be able to create new content, upload files, or write articles.
    - **Searching:** Utilize the search bar to find specific topics or keywords.
    - **Commenting/Discussing:** Engage with content by leaving comments or participating in discussion threads.

Enjoy exploring and contributing to The Knowledge Bay!

# 🌐 API Endpoints

The following is a selection of key API endpoints available in The Knowledge Bay. For a complete list and more detailed information, please examine the controller classes within the `server/src/main/java/co/edu/uniquindio/theknowledgebay/api/controller/` directory. The base path for all API endpoints is `/api`.

### 🔑 Authentication Endpoints (`/api/auth`)

-   `POST /register`: Registers a new user.
-   `POST /login`: Logs in an existing user and returns a JWT token upon successful authentication.
-   `POST /logout`: Logs out the currently authenticated user.

### 📝 Content Endpoints (`/api/content`)

-   `POST /`: Creates new content (e.g., article, resource). Supports multipart requests for file uploads.
-   `GET /my-content`: Retrieves all content created by the currently authenticated user.
-   `GET /`: Retrieves all content available in the system.
-   `GET /{id}`: Retrieves a specific piece of content by its unique ID.
-   `PUT /{id}`: Updates an existing piece of content by its ID.
-   `DELETE /{id}`: Deletes a specific piece of content by its ID.
-   `POST /{id}/like`: Likes a specific piece of content.
-   `DELETE /{id}/like`: Removes a like from a specific piece of content.

### 👥 User Endpoints (`/api/users`)

-   `GET /`: Retrieves a list of all users. Supports optional query parameters for filtering, such as:
    -   `search` (string): Filters users by username or other profile fields.
    -   `interest` (string): Filters users by declared interests.
-   `GET /{userId}`: Retrieves profile information for a specific user by their `userId`. 
-   `PUT /profile`: Updates the profile information of the currently authenticated user.
-   `POST /{userId}/follow`: Allows the authenticated user to follow the user specified by `userId`. 
-   `DELETE /{userId}/follow`: Allows the authenticated user to unfollow the user specified by `userId`. 
-   `GET /search?query={searchTerm}`: Searches for users based on a `searchTerm`. This might be an alias or a more specific search than the general `GET /` with a search parameter.

# 🧪 Testing

1.  **Running Tests:**
    To execute the unit and integration tests for the server-side Spring Boot application, navigate to the `server` directory and use the following Maven command:
    ```bash
    cd server
    mvn test
    ```
    This command will compile the test classes, run all tests annotated with `@Test` (or similar, depending on the testing framework like JUnit), and report the results.

# ⚡ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get The Knowledge Bay up and running quickly on your local machine. This guide assumes you have all prerequisites installed (see the [Prerequisites](#-prerequisites) section).

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegnghtmr/the-knowledge-bay
cd the-knowledge-bay
```

**2. Set Up and Run the Back-End (Server):**
Open a new terminal window for the server.
```bash
cd server
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
# The server will typically be running on http://localhost:8080
```
Wait until the server has started successfully. You should see log messages indicating it's ready.

**3. Set Up and Run the Front-End (Client):**
Open another new terminal window for the client.
```bash
cd ../client 
npm install
npm run dev
# The client will typically be accessible at http://localhost:3000
```
The client development server will usually open the application in your default web browser automatically, or it will display the URL in the terminal.

**4. Open in Browser:**
If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated in your client terminal) in your web browser.

You should now have The Knowledge Bay running locally! For more detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Installation and Setup](#-installation-and-setup) section.
# 💡 Tips & Tricks

Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of The Knowledge Bay platform and its development environment:

**For Users:**

-   🌟 **Explore Advanced Search:** Don't just use keywords! Check if there are filters or advanced syntax available to narrow down your search results for content more effectively.
-   👤 **Complete Your Profile:** A well-filled profile can help others with similar interests connect with you and can personalize your experience on the platform.
-   💬 **Engage in Discussions:** The forums or comment sections are great places to ask questions, share your understanding, and learn from others.
-   🔖 **Use Bookmarking/Favorites:** If the platform allows, save interesting content for later so you can easily find it again.
-   🤝 **Collaborate (if applicable):** Look for features that allow collaboration, like shared documents, study groups, or joint projects.

**For Developers:**

-   📄 **Check the `docs/` Folder:** This directory often contains more in-depth diagrams, architectural notes, and design mockups that aren't in the main README.
-   🐛 **Effective Debugging:**
    -   **Client:** Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab, Console, React DevTools extension).
    -   **Server:** Leverage your IDE's debugger for Java. Check server logs in the `server/logs` directory (if configured) or console output.
-   🔄 **Understand the Build Tools:** Familiarize yourself with `vite.config.js` (client) and `pom.xml` (server) to understand build processes, dependencies, and available scripts/goals.
-   🐞 **Reporting Issues:** When you find a bug or have a feature idea, provide clear, detailed information when opening an issue. Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
-   🌲 **Branching Strategy:** Follow the project's branching strategy (e.g., feature branches from `develop` or `main`) when contributing.
