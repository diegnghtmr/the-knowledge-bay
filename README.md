# 🌐 API Endpoints

The following is a selection of key API endpoints available in The Knowledge Bay. For a complete list and more detailed information, please examine the controller classes within the `server/src/main/java/co/edu/uniquindio/theknowledgebay/api/controller/` directory (or the relevant path in your project). The base path for all API endpoints is `/api`.

### 🔑 Authentication Endpoints (`/api/auth`)

-   `POST /register`: Registers a new user. No authorization required.
-   `POST /login`: Logs in an existing user and returns a JWT token upon successful authentication. No authorization required.
-   `POST /logout`: Logs out the currently authenticated user. Requires Authorization token (JWT).

### 📝 Content Endpoints (`/api/content`)

-   `POST /`: Creates new content (e.g., article, resource). Requires Authorization token. Supports multipart requests for file uploads.
-   `GET /my-content`: Retrieves all content created by the currently authenticated user. Requires Authorization token.
-   `GET /`: Retrieves all content available in the system. No authorization typically required, but may depend on content visibility settings.
-   `GET /{id}`: Retrieves a specific piece of content by its unique ID. No authorization typically required.
-   `PUT /{id}`: Updates an existing piece of content by its ID. Requires Authorization token and user must be the owner of the content or have administrative privileges.
-   `DELETE /{id}`: Deletes a specific piece of content by its ID. Requires Authorization token and user must be the owner of the content or have administrative privileges.
-   `POST /{id}/like`: Likes a specific piece of content. Requires Authorization token.
-   `DELETE /{id}/like`: Removes a like from a specific piece of content. Requires Authorization token.

### 👥 User Endpoints (`/api/users`)

-   `GET /`: Retrieves a list of all users. May require administrative privileges. Supports optional query parameters for filtering, such as:
    -   `search` (string): Filters users by username or other profile fields.
    -   `interest` (string): Filters users by declared interests.
-   `GET /{userId}`: Retrieves profile information for a specific user by their `userId`. Requires Authorization token.
-   `PUT /profile`: Updates the profile information of the currently authenticated user. Requires Authorization token.
-   `POST /{userId}/follow`: Allows the authenticated user to follow the user specified by `userId`. Requires Authorization token.
-   `DELETE /{userId}/follow`: Allows the authenticated user to unfollow the user specified by `userId`. Requires Authorization token.
-   `GET /search?query={searchTerm}`: Searches for users based on a `searchTerm`. This might be an alias or a more specific search than the general `GET /` with a search parameter. Requires Authorization token.

_Note: "Authorization token" typically refers to a JWT Bearer token sent in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request._
# 🧪 Testing

This section describes how to run tests for both the client and server components of The Knowledge Bay.

## 💻 Client (Front-End)

1.  **Linting:**
    To check the client-side code for linting errors and ensure code style consistency, navigate to the `client` directory and run:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run lint
    ```

2.  **Unit/Integration Tests:**
    The `package.json` for the client does not specify a standard test script (e.g., `npm test`). Please consult specific project documentation, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or look for testing libraries and configurations (like Jest, React Testing Library) within the `client/src` directory to understand how to run client-side tests if they are implemented.

## ⚙️ Server (Back-End)

1.  **Running Tests:**
    To execute the unit and integration tests for the server-side Spring Boot application, navigate to the `server` directory and use the following Maven command:
    ```bash
    cd server
    mvn test
    ```
    This command will compile the test classes, run all tests annotated with `@Test` (or similar, depending on the testing framework like JUnit), and report the results.
